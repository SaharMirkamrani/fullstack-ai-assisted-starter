### Error Handling & Logging

```bash
# Secure Error Handling
"Implement secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information like database details, file paths, or internal system information."

# Security Logging
"Add security event logging for authentication attempts, authorization failures, and suspicious activities without logging sensitive data."

# Audit Trail
"Create an audit trail system to track user actions, data modifications, and security events for compliance and incident response."
```

## üîç Security Review Prompts

### Code Security Analysis

```bash
# Security Vulnerability Check

# Security Best Practices Review
"Check if this code follows security best practices including input validation, proper authentication, secure communication, and error handling."

# Dependency Security
"Review the dependencies in this project for known security vulnerabilities and suggest secure alternatives if needed."
```

### Penetration Testing Simulation

```bash
# Authentication Testing
"Simulate common authentication attacks on this login system including brute force, credential stuffing, and session hijacking attempts."

# Input Validation Testing
"Test this form for input validation bypasses including XSS payloads, SQL injection attempts, and file upload exploits."

# Authorization Testing
"Test this application for authorization bypasses including privilege escalation, horizontal privilege escalation, and access control failures."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Spam Protection Prompts

### Honeypot Implementation

```bash
# Honeypot Field
"Add a honeypot field to this form that's hidden from users but visible to bots. Include server-side validation to reject submissions with filled honeypot fields."

# reCAPTCHA Integration
"Integrate Google reCAPTCHA v3 into this form with proper client-side and server-side validation. Handle verification failures gracefully."
```

### Rate Limiting for Forms

```bash
# Form Rate Limiting
"Implement rate limiting for this contact form: maximum 3 submissions per hour per IP address with proper error messages and logging."
```

## üîß Implementation Prompts

### Frontend Security

```bash
# React Security
"Create a secure React component for user input that includes proper validation, XSS protection, and CSRF token handling."

# Next.js Security
"Configure Next.js security headers and implement secure authentication flow with proper token management and session handling."

# Form Security
"Build a secure form component with client-side validation, CSRF protection, and proper error handling without exposing sensitive information."
```

### Backend Security

```bash
# Express Security
"Set up a secure Express.js application with Helmet.js, CORS configuration, rate limiting, and proper error handling."

# Database Security
"Implement secure database operations with parameterized queries, input validation, and proper user context validation."

# API Security
