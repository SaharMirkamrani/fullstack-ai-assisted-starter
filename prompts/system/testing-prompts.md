2. **Write clear, readable test code** with descriptive names
3. **Test one thing at a time** with focused test cases
4. **Use proper assertions** and error messages
5. **Maintain test independence** and avoid test coupling

### After Writing Tests

1. **Run tests regularly** and fix failures promptly

## üìù Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the relevant prompt** for your specific testing scenario
2. **Customize the prompt** with your specific requirements
3. **Follow the testing approach** suggested by the AI
4. **Implement tests** with proper structure and coverage
5. **Run and validate tests** to ensure they work correctly
6. **Maintain and update tests** as the application evolves

## üîÑ Regular Testing Practices

- **Daily**: Run unit tests and fix failures
- **Weekly**: Review test coverage and add missing tests
- **Monthly**: Conduct test quality reviews and refactoring
- **Quarterly**: Update testing strategies and tools
