## üöÄ Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow Integration

#### 1. Feature Development
```bash
# Start with architecture review
"Review the architecture for this new feature using the patterns in architecture.md"

# Add security considerations
"Implement this feature with security best practices from security-prompts.md"

# Write comprehensive tests
"Create tests for this feature using testing-prompts.md strategies"

# Ensure quality
"Review code quality using quality-assurance-prompts.md guidelines"
```

#### 2. Bug Fixing
```bash
# Systematic debugging
"Debug this issue using the systematic approach from debugging-prompts.md"

# Add tests to prevent regression
"Write tests for this bug fix using testing-prompts.md"

# Review security implications
"Check security implications using security-prompts.md"
```

#### 3. Code Review
```bash
# Quality review
"Review this code for quality issues using quality-assurance-prompts.md"

# Security review
"Check for security vulnerabilities using security-prompts.md"

# Test coverage review
"Review test coverage using testing-prompts.md"
```

## üìã Best Practices

### Using Prompts Effectively

1. **Copy and Customize**: Copy relevant prompts and customize for your specific needs
2. **Combine Prompts**: Use multiple prompts together for comprehensive solutions
3. **Iterate**: Use prompts iteratively to refine and improve solutions
4. **Document**: Keep track of which prompts work best for your team
5. **Share**: Share effective prompt combinations with your team

### Prompt Customization

#### Template Structure
```bash
# Original prompt
"Create a secure login endpoint with proper validation"

# Customized prompt
"Create a secure login endpoint for our React/Node.js app with JWT authentication, 
rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes), and comprehensive error handling. 
Use the patterns from our existing auth system."
```

#### Context Addition
```bash
# Add project context
"Given our current tech stack (React, Node.js, MongoDB) and existing patterns, 
implement this feature following our established conventions."
```

## üîÑ Regular Maintenance
